-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.

I plan to hold the data for the board in nested arrays. One array for each row,
with 3 elements, one for each column. This will simulate a 3x3 two dimensional
array. Each element will be assigned either null, "O" or "X".

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

Is this the same question as above? I'm not sure I understand.

-   How you plan to approach this project.

As always, solve small problems first. I plan to start with wireframes and user
stories and move on to basic HTML. Soon after will most likely be event listeners
for clicks on the board. The javascript functionality will come later.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

As a user, I wish to play a game of tic tac toe against a friend (epic)
As a user, I wish to see a simple and intuitive interface
As a user, I wish to be able to play on any devise with a browser.
As a developer, I wish to keep this game modular for similar projects
As

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

I plan for the CSS to handle different (any) sized screens. I plan to stay away
from hardcoding any number values, so theoretically the project could move on
to larger boards and more than two teams. (I doubt I will personally get to this)

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?

Tournament mode: Choose best out of 5 or 7 or something similar

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

Obviously I will be using git for version controll. I will have several branches
off of master, probably broken up into the different languages: JS, HTML, CSS,
ajax, etc.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

I do plan on trying the multiple game tournament mode, but only if I have time
of course.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
